1) Add multiple Accession ID for multiple sequence allignment in text file
2) Goto Batch Entrez (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez)
3) Add text file and retrieve
4) Select all items > Send to > FASTA file
5) Open aliview and open .fasta file
6) Select all and Align > everything 
7) For Global alignment [EMBOSS needle] (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/psa/emboss_needle)
	Paste first sequence and second sequence, output format "pair" (look for the gap)
8) For Local alignment [EMBOSS water]
	Paste first sequence and second sequence, output format "pair" (look for the gap)

9) For Multiple Sequence Alignment [Clustal Omega] (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo?stype=protein)
	Paste all sequences, output format "ClustalW"

10) Open MEGA -> ALIGN -> edit/build alignment -> create new alignment -> DNA -> Data -> Open -> retrieve sequences from file -> select fasta file
11) Alignment tab -> Align by ClustalW / Align by MUSCLE 
    Data tab -> Phylogenetic analysis
12) PHYLOGENY -> construct maximum likelihood tree -> 
			test of phylogeny = "standard bootstrap"
			 Bootstrap Replicates = 500
							ok-> progress.......... Tree constructed
