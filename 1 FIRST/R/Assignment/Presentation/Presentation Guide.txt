Saturday 11 May 2024 presentation 
(each will get 5 minutes for presentation, 5-7 slides must be uploaded in the separate assignment with Google Slides posted in the Google Classroom by this Friday midnight):

Roll Number: 1 Abin, 5 Atul, 9 Dipesh, 13 Kaushal, 17 Niraj, 21 Pawan, 29 sashwat, 33 Suman

(Generate 200 random data with one continuous dependent variable and five independent variables, random seed = your roll number. 
Then fit bivariate and multivariate linear regression model, check VIF, BLUE and LINE and 
predict for the test data (30% sample) 
compare it with KNN regression, ANN regression and Support Vector Regression using R-square and RMSE of test data and 
find the best supervised regression model for this data.

Roll Number: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34 
(Generate 200 random data with one binary/dichotomous dependent variable and two continuous independent variables and three categorical independent variables, random seed = your roll number.
Then fit bivariate and multivariate logistic regression model, check VIF and BLUE and 
predict it for test data (20% sample) and also compare it with Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, Tuned Random Forest and Boosting using confusion matrix of test data and
find the best supervised classification model for this data.

Roll Number: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35 
(Generate 100 random data with ten continuous independent variables, random seed = your roll number). 
Then fit PCA, PCA with Varimax rotation, MDS, MDS with Shannon's stress minimization with Bi-plots and interpret them carefully. 
Compare final PCA with final MDS model graphically.
 Finally, find the best unsupervised dimension reduction model for this data.

Roll Number: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 
(Generate 100 random data with seven continuous independent variables where first independent variable must be the identification variable with name (text), random seed = your roll number. Then fit Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) with four methods and decide how many clusters (k) must be used for the k-means clustering for each method. 
Fit k-means clustering for all the methods using the pre-identified k values for each method. 
Finally, find the best unsupervised clustering model for this data and show it using base r graph and cluster package.

Note: This presentation carries 5 marks out of 12 marks of internal marks available to me so make sure to give your best for it. I will score it for format (1), content (2), presentation (1) and Q&A (1) in the classroom. Another 5 marks will come from homework (assignments/projects) and 2 marks from offline/online class "Discipline".
