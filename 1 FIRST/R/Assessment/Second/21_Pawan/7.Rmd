This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# dataset
aq <- airquality
head(aq)
str(aq)
```
1
```{r warning=FALSE}
1.
# gof test for temp variable 
# test normality 
# using confirmative test : kolmogorov-smirov test for sample size 153
ks.test(aq$Temp,'pnorm')
```
Interpretation:
we can see that the p-value is less than 0.05 .So we can conclude that the sample is not normal


2.
```{r}
library(car)
leveneTest(Temp~factor(Month),data = aq)
```
Interpretation:
Since the categories of months are greater than 2 , we use leveneTest.
Since , p-value <0.05, we can conclude there is not equal variance between these two variables

3. 
Since the p-value is less than 0.05 , we need to use post-hoc test. 

4.
The best independent sample statistical test for the data is TukeyHSD test

```{r}
TukeyHSD(aov(Temp~factor(Month),data = aq))
```

Here we can see that month 8 -7 has highest p adj. Also months 18 7-5 ans 8-5 has difference in mean 18.
