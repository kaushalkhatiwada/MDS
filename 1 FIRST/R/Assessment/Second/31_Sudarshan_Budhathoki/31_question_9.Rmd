*The multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis performed on the city distances data helps visualize the spatial relationships between the ten cities in a two-dimensional plot. The distances between cities in the original data are translated into relative positions in the plot, with cities closer together indicating shorter distances and cities farther apart representing greater distances. This bi-plot allows for a quick visual interpretation of the similarities and differences in distances between the cities.
